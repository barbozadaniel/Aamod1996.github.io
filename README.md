# [Deep Q Learning](https://github.com/Aamod1996/Deep-Q-Learning)

Deep Q Learning algorithms is one of the first and also a very powerful algorithm which combines the best from both worlds - Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. In this repository I have implemented the algorithm using PyTorch and tested it on an environment from Unity ML Agents. If you want to train your own agent you can follow the instructions in the repository.
